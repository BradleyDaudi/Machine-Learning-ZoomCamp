## 🎯 Why I'm Taking This Zoomcamp

Machine learning is reshaping how the world works — from product recommendations to self-driving cars.  
This Zoomcamp isn't just a course for me — it's a mission to **build real skills**, understand the **ML lifecycle**, and grow into a thoughtful, production-ready data scientist.

## ✨ My Favorite Learning Moments

- 📌 **Week 2:** Realizing how much story raw data can tell with just a few visualizations.
- 🤯 **Week 3:** Seeing a linear regression model go from math to working predictions in minutes.
- 🚀 **Coming Soon:** Deploying my own model and sharing it with friends in a browser!

## 💡 Final Project (Coming Soon)

> **Title**: *Predicting Customer Churn for a Subscription-Based App*

**Goal:** Use classification to predict which users are likely to churn and why.

**Deliverables:**
- Trained model
- Streamlit app or API via Flask
- GitHub repo + blog write-up
